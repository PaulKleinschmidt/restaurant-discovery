# AllTrails Restaurant Discovery Code Challenge

This repo contains my solution to the AllTrails interview code challenge. The frontend is built using React and Typescript, and a Rails API is used to expose the Google Places API. The frontend and API code can be found in the `/client` and `/server` folders respectively. See their README files to get started:

- [Client](https://github.com/PaulKleinschmidt/restaurant-discovery/blob/main/client/README.md)
- [Server](https://github.com/PaulKleinschmidt/restaurant-discovery/blob/main/server/README.md)
